                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p> Years after an ancient evil was salvaged from the depths of the sea, Jotaro Kujo sits peacefully within a Japanese jail cell. 
                He's committed no crime yet demands he not be released, believing he's been possessed by an evil spirit capable of harming those around him. 
                Concerned for her son, Holly Kuujou asks her father, Joseph Joestar, to convince Jotaro to leave the prison. Joseph informs his grandson 
                that the "evil spirit" is in fact something called a "Stand," the physical manifestation of one's fighting spirit which can adopt a variety 
                of deadly forms. After a fiery brawl with Joseph's friend Mohammed Avdol, Joutarou is forced out of his cell and begins learning how to control 
                the power of his Stand. However, when a Stand awakens within Holly and threatens to consume her in 50 days, Jotaro, his grandfather, and their 
                allies must seek out and destroy the immortal vampire responsible for her condition. They must travel halfway across the world to Cairo, Egypt 
                and along the way, do battle with ferocious Stand users set on thwarting them. If Jotaro and his allies fail in their mission, humanity is 
                destined for a grim fate.</p>

                <p> Jotaro Kujo is the main protagonist of the Stardust Crusaders story arc</p>
                
                <p> Jotaro Kujo (空条 承太郎 Kūjō Jōtarō), the grandson of Joseph Joestar. In Japan, Jotaro is a troublesome student who 
                regularly gets into fights at school and antagonizes his teachers. He is put in prison after beating up three armed men and
                a trained boxer, but he refuses to leave, claiming he's possessed by an evil spirit. To demonstrate, he takes a gun and shoots
                himself in the head, but the bullet is stopped by an arm shooting from his hand that only he and his mother Holy can see. Joseph 
                Joestar soon arrives with his friend Mohammed Avdol. A battle ensues between Avdol and Jotaro in which Avdol manifests his own evil
                spirit, using it to provoke Jotaro out of the cell. Joseph explains that Jotaro's "evil spirit" is actually a Stand, a manifestation 
                of psychic power. Jotaro's Stand, named Star Platinum, possesses incredible precision and strength; Avdol's Stand, known as Magician's 
                Red, can control fire; Joseph's Stand, Hermit Purple, manifests as thorny vines that allow him to manipulate electronics, 
                capturing images from a great distance at the cost of destroying said electronics..</p>

                 <p>Joseph reveals that Jotaro's and his own Stand, having both manifested recently, appeared because of the reemergence 
                 of Dio Brando (now referred to as simply "DIO"). When he sank to the bottom of the sea, DIO attached his severed head to 
                 Jonathan Joestar's body. However, DIO's newfound Joestar blood linked him to the rest of the family, and thus when DIO began
                 to develop a Stand, Joseph and Jotaro did as well. DIO vows to destroy the Joestar family and sends a student, Noriaki Kakyoin,
                 to dispose of Jotaro. Kakyoin's Stand, Hierophant Green, possesses a nurse and attacks Jotaro with its Emerald Splash maneuver,
                 but Jotaro defeats him soundly.</p>

                 they kill DIO within fifty days and thus break his Stand's influence, Holly will die..</p> <br>

                 a man with two right hands and user of the Hanged Man, a Stand of light that attacks from mirrors. Polnareff avenges his sister by slaying
                 her murderer, J. Geil, but Avdol is seemingly killed by Hol Horse, who flees the scene.</p>

                 by Jotaro and Iggy. Afterwards, Kakyoin is taken to a hospital to recuperate. Oingo and Boingo, users of the face-altering 
                 stand Khnum and the future-predicting comic book Thoth respectively, attempt to defeat the heroes, but Oingo 
                 (in disguise as Jotaro) is incapacitated without the heroes even knowing he was there. Anubis, a sword with a
                 Stand, possesses a farmer named Chaka, a barber named Khan, and then Polnareff, nearly killing Jotaro before being

                 cheeks cut open. DIO chases Joseph and Kakyoin across Cairo until Kakyoin, at the price of his life, discovers that DIO's Stand, 
                 The World, is able to stop time. After incapacitating Joseph, DIO is confronted by Jotaro. Though The World has a huge advantage
                 in the ability to stop time, Jotaro nearly defeats DIO, thanks to Jotaro being able to slightly move during DIO's stopped time as
                 a result of Star Platinum and The World being the same type of Stand. DIO restores himself by draining Joseph's blood, becoming
                 even stronger. DIO attempts to finish off Jotaro by crushing him with a steamroller, but Jotaro manages to use Star Platinum to
                 fully stop time against DIO and defeat him.</p>
