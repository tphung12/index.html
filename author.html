                <h2>Hirohiko Araki</h2>
                <p> Hirohiko Araki (Japanese: 荒木 飛呂彦 Hepburn: Araki Hirohiko?, born June 7, 1960 in Sendai, Miyagi) is a 
                Japanese manga artist. He made his debut under the name Toshiyuki Araki (荒木 利之 Araki Toshiyuki?) in 1980
                with his one-shot Poker Under Arms, and began his professional career with the short series Cool Shock B.T.,
                Baoh, and The Gorgeous Irene. Araki is best known for his long-running series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, first
                published in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1986 and which to date has sold over 80 million copies in Japan alone. The 
                story frequently references rock music and Italy, both of which Araki is reportedly very fond of.[1]</p>
