                <p> <strong>Jotaro Kujo</strong> is the main protagonist of the Stardust Crusaders story arc</p>
                
                <p>Jotaro is introduced in the series as a delinquent but is kind and loyal to his friends. 
                Jotaro's most noticeable trait is his seemingly aloof nature. He is a quiet individual, often 
                satisfied with expressing himself in short phrases. Araki has explained that he thinks anyone 
                can tell his emotions just by looking at him, and probably thinks further effort in portraying how 
                he feels to be a waste of time, making others tend to perceive Jotaro as callous.</p>

                <p> Joseph's goofy side is present during the journey, 
                 and Joseph's somewhat frequent failures at blending with the local culture and his struggle at battling Stands are a constant source of humor

                <p><strong>Noriaki Kakyoin</strong> Initially a Japanese student visiting Egypt, he is manipulated by DIO

                to Egypt to save Jotaro's mother and find redemption.  </p>
                
                <p>     First introduced as an evil and cruel teenager because of DIO's brainwashing, Noriaki Kakyoin reveals himself as a righteous, though blunt individual.
                        Kakyoin is a righteous individual. His reason for joining the Joestar Group being both fighting evil, as he mirrors Jotaro's own explanations for saving
                        his life, and of course a sense of debt toward Jotaro for saving his life. </p>

               <p><strong>Muhammad Avdol</strong> is introduced as an old friend of Joeseph Joestar. He is of Egyptian decent and joins at the beginning of the Stardust Crusaders ark </p>
               
              <p> Avdol possesses a "strong sense of duty and loyalty". He is highly dedicated to slaying DIO as one of the 
               two first members of the party; remarkably so since he is the only one not to fight him for personal reasons. When Tower 
               of Gray gratuitously killed unrelated bystanders, Avdol was furious. Besides, Avdol is willing to die for his comrades.</p>
               
               <p>However besides his seriousness, Avdol can be a jovial individual, he knows his strength and is very confident in his abilities</p>

               <p>Polnareff's most defining trait is his honor. His first appearance has him handicap himself on purpose by explaining 
               his ability and fight his opponent Avdol in a terrain more suitable to the latter. Polnareff's honor is such that even under 
               the control of Dio, he refuses to do something as dishonorable as attacking someone from the back. Adopting a chivalrous mindset, 
               Polnareff is reluctant to flee from a fight or use dishonorable tactics, although he can be persuaded. </p>

               His paws, stomach, chest and neck are white, as are the area around his mouth and his forehead. 
               His eyes bulge slightly, and he has loose jowls..</p>
               
               <p>Iggy is initially described as a particularly antisocial dog with a bad personality. His favorite treat is coffee-flavored chewing gum. 
               He also enjoys chewing on human hair and farting in human faces. To begin with, he antagonizes Jean Pierre Polnareff most of all but is nasty
               to everyone around him. </p>
